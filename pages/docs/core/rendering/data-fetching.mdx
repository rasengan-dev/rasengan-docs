# Data Fetching 

Data fetching is the process of fetching data required to render a page. This data can be fetched from various sources, such as a database, an API, or a file system.

In `Rasengan.js`, at this time you just have one way to fetch data, which is using the `loader` function.:

- **Dynamic Data Fetching**: You can fetch data at runtime using `PageComponent.loader` function. This data will be fetched on the server when the page is requested by the client.

## Example

```tsx filename="home.page.tsx" showLineNumbers copy
import { PageComponent } from "rasengan";

type Props = {
  data: any
}

const Home: PageComponent = ({ data }: Props) => {
  // data is fetched from the server and passed as props dynamically at runtime

  return (
    <div>Home page</div>
  )
}

Home.path = "/";

Home.loader = async () => {
  const data = await fetch("https://api.example.com/data");
  const json = await data.json();

  return {
    props: {
      data: json,
    }
  }
}

export default Home;
```

## Use Cases

- **Fetching Data from an API**: You can fetch data from an API and pass it as props to the page component.
- **Implementing and authentication strategy**: You can fetch user data from a database and pass it as props, which can be used to authenticate the user. 
And if the user is not authenticated, you can redirect them to the login page by just returning a `redirect` object from the `loader` function.

## Conclusion

Data fetching is an essential part of building a web application. In `Rasengan.js`, you can fetch data dynamically using the `loader` function. This data will be fetched on the server when the page is requested by the client.
