# Component Rendering 

In `Rasengan.js`, the components are rendered on the server using `React` and `Express`. 

When the user makes a request to the server, the server will render the React components and send the final HTML to the client's browser.

Rasengan.js supports only Client Components. Comparing to Next.js, Rasengan.js doesn't support Server Components, which are components that can do server action directly like fetching data from the database.

```jsx 
const Home = () => {
  // This is a client component

  // You can use hooks, context, etc.

  // You can access the browser's API

  return (
    <div>Home page</div>
  )
}

Home.path = "/";

export default Home;
```
