# Introduction to Rendering

In the context of `React`, `rendering` refers to the process of transforming React components into the final user interface that is displayed on the screen. 
React uses a `virtual DOM` (Document Object Model) to efficiently update and manipulate the UI. Learn more on the [official React documentation](https://react.dev/learn/render-and-commit).

There are two approaches of rendering in React, `Server Side Rendering` (SSR) and `client Side Rendering` (CSR). We will show you the difference between the two in this documentation.

Rasengan.js is using `Server Side Rendering` to render the React components. 

## `CSR` vs `SSR`

### `Client Side Rendering` (CSR)

`Client Side Rendering` (CSR), in React involves rendering the user interface entirely on the client's browser using JavaScript. There is no server involved in the rendering process, all is done on the client's browser.
