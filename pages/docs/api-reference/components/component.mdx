# Component

The `Component` React component is the main component provided by Rasengan.js to setting up all the routing system based on the `AppRouter` that it receives as a prop.

This component is used inside the `main.tsx` file (the entry point of the application) to set up the routing system.

## Usage

<Tabs items={['TypeScript', 'JavaScript']}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    ```tsx filename="main.tsx" {5} showLineNumbers copy /Component/
    import { type AppProps } from "rasengan";
    import AppRouter from "@app/app.router";

    export default function App({ Component, children }: AppProps) {
      return <Component router={AppRouter}>{children}</Component>;
    }
    ```

  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    ```jsx filename="main.jsx" {4} showLineNumbers copy /Component/
    import AppRouter from "@app/app.router";

    export default function App({ Component, children }) {
      return <Component router={AppRouter}>{children}</Component>;
    }
    ```

  </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

<AlertBox>
  The `Component` component is injected by Rasengan.js into the `App` component,
  it's the only way to have access to that component.
</AlertBox>

The `Component` component receives the `router` prop, which is the `AppRouter` class that contains all the routes of the application.
It will be responsible for setting up the routing system based on the routes defined in the `AppRouter` class.

## Props

The `Component` component accepts two props:

- `router`: The `AppRouter` class that contains all the routes of the application.
- `children`: The children of the `Component` component, which represents all the routing system of the application.
