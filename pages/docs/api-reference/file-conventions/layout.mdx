# [name].layout.js

In Rasengan.js, to create a `layout`, you have to create a file that follow the following name pattern: 

```txt showLineNumbers copy /layout.js/
[name].layout.js
```

A `layout` is UI that is shared between routes.

## Example 

<Tabs items={['TypeScript', 'JavaScript']} defaultIndex="1">
  <Tabs.Tab>
    ```tsx filename="app.layout.tsx" showLineNumbers copy /app.layout.tsx/
    import { LayoutComponent, Outlet } from "rasengan";

    /*
     * This AppLayout is located inside the app.layout.tsx file
     */
    const AppLayout: LayoutComponent = () => {
      return (
        <div>
          <h1>App Layout</h1>

          <Outlet />
        </div>
      )
    }
    
    AppLayout.path = "/";

    export default AppLayout;
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    ```jsx filename="app.layout.jsx" showLineNumbers copy  /app.layout.jsx/
    import { Outlet } from "rasengan";

    /*
     * This AppLayout is located inside the app.layout.tsx file
     */
    const AppLayout = () => {
      return (
        <div>
          <h1>App Layout</h1>

          <Outlet />
        </div>
      )
    }
    
    AppLayout.path = "/";

    export default AppLayout;
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

Based on the convention, we have juste replace the `[name]` by `app` in the convention name and we got `app.layout.js`.

Following the convention, is not required but, keeping that convention will help you recognizing the purpose of each files you will have.
