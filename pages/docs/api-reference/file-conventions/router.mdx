# [name].router.js

In Rasengan.js, to create a `router`, you have to create a file that follow the following name pattern:

```txt showLineNumbers copy /router.js/
[name].router.js
```

A `router` is a set of pages grouped under the same `layout` that share it.

## Example

<Tabs items={['TypeScript', 'JavaScript']} defaultIndex="1">
  <Tabs.Tab>
    ```tsx filename="app.router.tsx" showLineNumbers copy /app.router.tsx/
    import { RouterComponent, defineRouter } from "rasengan";
    import AppLayout from "@app/app.layout";
    import Home from "@app/home.page";
    import About from "@app/about.page";

    /*
     * This AppRouter is located inside the app.router.tsx file
     */
    class AppRouter extends RouterComponent {}

    export default defineRouter({
      imports: [],
      layout: AppLayout,
      pages: [Home, About],
    })(AppRouter);
    ```

  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    ```jsx filename="app.router.jsx" showLineNumbers copy /app.router.jsx/
    import { RouterComponent, defineRouter } from "rasengan";
    import AppLayout from "@app/app.layout";
    import Home from "@app/home.page";
    import About from "@app/about.page";

    /*
     * This AppRouter is located inside the app.router.jsx file
     */
    class AppRouter extends RouterComponent {}

    export default defineRouter({
      imports: [],
      layout: AppLayout,
      pages: [Home, About],
    })(AppRouter);
    ```

  </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

Based on the convention, we have juste replace the `[name]` by `app` in the convention name and we got `app.router.js`.

<AlertBox type="error">
  It's required to have your main `router` inside the `app/app.router.js` page,
  because it's considered as an `entry` point.
</AlertBox>
