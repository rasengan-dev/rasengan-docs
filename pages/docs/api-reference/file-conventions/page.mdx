# [name].page.js

In Rasengan.js, to create a `page`, you have to create a file that follow the following name pattern: 

```txt showLineNumbers copy /page.js/
[name].page.js
```

A `page` is UI that is unique to a route.

## Example

<Tabs items={['TypeScript', 'JavaScript']} defaultIndex="1">
  <Tabs.Tab>
    ```tsx filename="home.page.tsx" showLineNumbers copy /home.page.tsx/
    import { PageComponent } from "rasengan";

    /*
     * This Home Page is located inside the home.page.tsx file
     */
    const Home: pageComponent = () => {
      return (
        <div>
          <h1>Home Page</h1>
        </div>
      )
    }
    
    Home.path = "/";
    Home.metadata = {
      title: "Home",
      description: "This is the home page",
    }

    export default Home;
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    ```jsx filename="home.page.jsx" showLineNumbers copy /home.page.jsx/
    import React from "react";

    /*
     * This Home Page is located inside the home.page.tsx file
     */
    const Home = () => {
      return (
        <div>
          <h1>Home Page</h1>
        </div>
      )
    }
    
    Home.path = "/";
    Home.metadata = {
      title: "Home",
      description: "This is the home page",
    }

    export default Home;
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

Based on the convention, we have juste replace the `[name]` by `home` in the convention name and we got `home.page.js`.

<AlertBox>
Following the convention, is not required but, keeping that convention will help you recognizing the purpose of each files you will have.
