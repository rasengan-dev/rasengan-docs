# Rasengan CLI

The Rasengan.js CLI allows you to develop, build, start your application, and more.

## development

`rasengan dev` starts the application in development mode with hot-code reloading, error reporting, and more.

```bash filename="terminal" copy
rasengan dev
```

This will start the application in development mode. The application will be available at `http://localhost:5320`.
The default port can be changed with -p, like so:

```bash filename="terminal" copy
rasengan dev -p 30terminal
```

Or configure it in the `rasengan.config.js` file:

```javascript filename="rasengan.config.js" copy {8}
import { defineConfig } from "rasengan";

export default defineConfig({
  reactStrictMode: true,

  server: {
    development: {
      port: 3000,
    },
  },
});
```

And just run `rasengan dev` again.

If you want to automatically open the browser after starting the development server, just enable the `server.development.open` property.

```javascript filename="rasengan.config.js" copy {9}
import { defineConfig } from "rasengan";

export default defineConfig({
  reactStrictMode: true,

  server: {
    development: {
      port: 3000,
      open: true,
    },
  },
});
```

## build

`rasengan build` creates a production build of your application in the `dist` directory.

```bash filename="terminal" copy
rasengan buildterminal
```

The output prompts showed is similar to the following:

```bash filename="terminal"

## prepare

`rasengan prepare` configure your application for production depending on the hosting strategy.

You have to select a hosting strategy, which is `vercel` for now.

```javascript filename="rasengan.config.js" copy {8}
import { defineConfig } from "rasengan";

export default defineConfig({
  reactStrictMode: true,

  server: {
    production: {
      hosting: "vercel",
    },
  },
});
```

<AlertBox type="tip">
  Actually, there is only one strategy supported, which is hosting on `vercel`.
  We are working on others.
</AlertBox>

```bash filename="terminal" copy
rasengan prepare
```

The output prompts showed is similar to the following:

```text filename="terminal"
Preparing your project for production...

Your project is configured to be hosted on vercel.
```

## start

`rasengan start` starts the application in production mode.

```bash filename="terminal" copy
rasengan start
```

This will start the application in production mode. The application will be available at `http://localhost:4320`.
