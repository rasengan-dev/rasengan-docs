# React Strict Mode

React Strict Mode is a tool for highlighting potential problems in an application. Like Fragment, StrictMode does not render any visible UI. It activates additional checks and warnings for its descendants.
It's very useful for debugging purposes.

## How to activate ?

```javascript filename="rasengan.config.js" copy
import { defineConfig } from 'rasengan';

export default defineConfig({
  reactStrictMode: true,
});
```

`reactStrictMode: true` will activate the Strict Mode for the entire application. To disable it, set `reactStrictMode: false`.
