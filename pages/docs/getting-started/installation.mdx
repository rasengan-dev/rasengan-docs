# Installation

System Requirements:

- [Node.js 18.19](https://nodejs.org) or later.
- macOS, Windows, and Linux are supported.


## Automatic Installation

We recommend starting a new Rasengan.js app using [create-rasengan](/docs/api/create-rasengan-app), which sets up everything automatically for you. 
To create a project, run:

```bash filename="Terminal"
  npx create-rasengan@latest new
```

On the installation process, you will see the following prompts:

```txt filename="Terminal"
  You are using Create Rasengan CLI ðŸŽ‰

  ? Enter the project name: my-app
  ? Select a version: 1.0.0-beta.2
  ? Select a language: typescript
  ? Select a template: blank
```

After the prompts, create-rasengan will create a folder with your project name. You will then have to install the required dependencies manually.

```bash filename="Terminal"
  cd my-app
  npm install
```

## Manual Installation

If you prefer to install Rasengan.js manually, you have to create a new project and install the required dependencies.

```bash filename="Terminal"
  mkdir my-app
  cd my-app
  npm init -y
  npm install rasengan@latest react@latest react-dom@latest
```

Open the `package.json` file and add the following scripts:

```json filename="package.json"
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "rasengan dev",
    "build": "rasengan build",
    "prepare": "rasengan prepare",
    "preview": "rasengan preview"
  }
```

These scripts refer to the different stages of developing an application:

- `dev`: runs `rasengan dev` to start Rasengan.js in development mode.
- `build`: runs `rasengan build` to build the application for production usage.
- `prepare`: runs `rasengan prepare` to setup configuration need for hosting your application.
- `preview`: runs `rasengan preview` to start a Rasengan.js production server.
