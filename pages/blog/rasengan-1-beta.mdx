  Based on modern tools, Rasengan.js will help you to create **high-quality web applications** with the benefit of React Components. It's a simple and easy-to-use framework that will help you to create a **beautiful and responsive web application**.

  - [**`SSR`**](/docs/core/rendering/introduction#server-side-rendering-ssr): Rasengan.js supports server-side rendering (SSR) out of the box. This rendering approach is useful for SEO and performance optimization.

  ## Built with modern tools

  Rasengan.js is built with modern tools like:

  - [**`React`**](https://react.dev): A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
  - [**`Vite`**](https://vitejs.dev): A build tool that aims to provide a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects.
  - [**`React Router`**](https://reactrouter.com): A routing library for React.

  ## Why Rasengan.js?

  Rasengan.js is a simple and easy-to-use framework that will help you to create a beautiful and responsive web application. It is built with modern tools like React, Vite, and React Router, which makes it a great choice for your web application.

  The reason that the creator of Rasengan.js ([Dilane Kombou](https://twitter.com/dilanekombou)) decided to create this framework is because of the lack of performance while using only React and Vite. If you want to improve the performance of your web application by using only React and Vite, you need to do a lot of configurations and optimizations. 
  But with Rasengan.js, you don't need to worry about that. It is already optimized for performance and provides a simple and easy-to-use API that will help you to create a high-quality web application.

  Rasengan.js works on top of the Server Side Rendering (SSR) which is useful for SEO and performance optimization. It also provides a simple and easy-to-use [`Data Fetching`](/docs/core/rendering/data-fetching) system that allows you to fetch data from an API (similar to `getServerSideProps` of Next.js).
